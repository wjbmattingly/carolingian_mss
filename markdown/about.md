# About
This application is in beta form. It makes available for researchers a database of a Word document originally created by Burton Van Name Edwards that collated known Carolingian works of scriptural exegesis. Python scripts were used to convert the original Word document into structured data. Because the parsing of the Word document was automated, errors may remain. If found, please reach out via Twitter @wjb_mattingly so that I can update the database. I cannot locate the original file I used, but a version can be found [here](https://emf.pages.tcnj.edu/early-medieval-forum/carolingian/)
