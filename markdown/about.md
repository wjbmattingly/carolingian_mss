# About (Version 0.0.2)
This application is in beta testing.

The app is a database of a Word document originally created by Burton Van Name Edwards that collated known Carolingian works of scriptural exegesis. Python scripts were used to convert the original Word document into structured data. Because the parsing of the original document was automated, errors may remain. If found, please reach out via Twitter @wjb_mattingly so that the datbase can be updated. The original document can be found [here](https://risd.digication.com/bvnedwards/Bibliography/edit)

# How to use the Application
In the left-hand sidebar of the application, you can select the exegete(s), the types of exegesis they wrote (Commentary, Homily, etc.), and the books (1 John, Genesis, etc.) on which they commented. Once you begin making your selections, the database will load up the results in the center of the screen.

When you have results that you want to save, you can click the button "Press to Download" to save the data as a .CSV file. This can be opened in Excel.
