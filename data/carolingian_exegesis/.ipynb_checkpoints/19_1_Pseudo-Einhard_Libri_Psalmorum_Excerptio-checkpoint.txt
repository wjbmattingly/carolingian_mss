19.1. [Pseudo-Einhard] Libri Psalmorum Excerptio.
Commentary | Psalms
Manuscripts:
1. Vercelli, Archivio Capitulare 149, f. 146-154. saec. ix3-4.
Authorship doubted by Salmon, but see Julia M.H. Smith, “Einhard: The Sinner and the Saints,” Transactions of the Royal Historical Society 13 (2003), 55-77 at p. 73n, who is much more inclined to see this as one of Einhard’s works..
