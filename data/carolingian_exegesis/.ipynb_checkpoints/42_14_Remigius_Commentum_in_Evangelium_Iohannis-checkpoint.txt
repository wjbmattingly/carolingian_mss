Bibliography:
1. Gorman, Michael, “The Commentary on the Gospel of John by Haimo of Auxerre,” Revue Bénédictine 115 (2005), 61-111 argues for Haimo’s authorship.  There are problems with this argument. 1. He assumes that Einsiedeln 181 is Haimo’s commentary on Matthew – that is unproven. 2. He pays insufficient attention to the relationship between Haimo’s authentic homilies and extant commentaries on Matthew. 3. The commentary on Matthew in Vat. Lat. 651 is very much sui generis.  4. Why wasn’t Petrus Tax’s 1989 article on Remigius cited (not that I agree with all of his conculsions)?  5. Riggenbach’s criteria for assigning works to Haimo are too vague to be useful and reliable.
